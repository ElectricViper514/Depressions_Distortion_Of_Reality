        <h2>Welcome to DDoR: Opening the Door to Truth</h2>

        <p>There’s a reason I chose the name <em>Depression’s Distortion of Reality</em> — or <strong>DDoR</strong> for short. For years, I’ve lived with the weight of depression and the way it twists the truth, warps perspective, and clouds the light. It’s like looking at life through a dirty window — the world beyond is still there, but the smudges and grime blur the details and dim the light.</p>

        <p>Yet even in the midst of that distortion, one truth has anchored me — a truth I can’t keep to myself: <strong>God is greater than the distortion.</strong> His light cuts through the fog. His truth shatters the lies. <strong>All we need to do is to simply open the door for a new perspective.</strong> And when I speak of “the door,” I’m speaking of Jesus Christ — God’s only begotten Son. As He Himself said, <em>“I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me”</em> (John 14:6, NASB 2020).</p>

        <p>In John 10:9, Jesus said, <em>“I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture”</em> (NASB 2020). This blog is about a journey marked by pain, sorrow, and disappointment — yet also by compassion, bliss, and contentment. It is not an easy path, but it is the path I follow nonetheless, all in testament to the greatest Teacher of all time, Jesus Christ. My prayer is that you’ll join me in stepping through that doorway, leaving the distortion behind, and walking toward the light of truth together.</p>

        <p>Following Christ shapes every part of my life — including the way I approach my work, my studies, and my creative projects. Faith is the foundation, but God has also given me a deep curiosity and drive to keep learning and building.</p>

        <p>This piqued my interest in computers when I was a small child and my parents brought home our first home PC — a TI‑99/4A. I was instantly captivated by the way pressing keys could transform into colors, sounds, and interactive experiences on the screen. What started as fascination quickly grew into a lifelong passion for technology, eventually drawing me toward a career in IT that focused on hardware and networking. These days, I’m shifting gears — learning to code for a career, rather than just dabbling here and there with scripts and basic programs. I’ve even gone back to school at my age to earn my bachelor’s degree in computer science. My goal isn’t just to write code, but to truly understand software development — the processes, the design principles, and the reasoning behind every decision. I want to know not only the <em>how</em>, but also the <em>why</em>.</p>

        <p>Life isn’t lived entirely behind a screen. After long hours of studying code and exploring the logic of software, I find peace in the garden — raised beds with arcs stretching from one bed to another, giving me more space by growing vertically in addition to horizontally. It’s a place where I reconnect with the physical world, where growth is slow, deliberate, and deeply rooted in trust. <strong>Transformation takes patience, gentle care, and faith in God’s timing.</strong> It’s a quiet, living metaphor for the work He’s doing in me.</p>

        <h3>Here, you’ll find:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encouragement</strong> for the days when the distortion feels overwhelming.</li>
          <li><strong>Compassion</strong> for those who feel unseen or misunderstood.</li>
          <li><strong>Truth</strong> from Scripture to help realign our vision with God’s reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Stories</strong> — my own and others’ — of finding light in the darkest places.</li>
          <li><strong>Snapshots of growth</strong> — in faith, in coding, and in the garden.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are reading this and you feel trapped in life — weighed down by distortion, confusion, or hopelessness — I want you to know there is a way forward. Jesus said, <em>“I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved”</em> (John 10:9, NASB 2020). This space is my invitation to you — to step through, to see more clearly, and to discover the reality that depression tries to hide.</p>

        <p><strong>Welcome to DDoR.<br />Welcome to the doorway.<br />Let’s walk through it together.</strong></p>
